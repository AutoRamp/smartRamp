								<p>
									Thanks to the IWA and their service user for allowing us to accompany them on a trip on a rail
									journey, documenting the experience to allow us to fully understand the issues with the rail system and to allow us
									find the issues that need to be tackled when designing this solution.
									Further thanks to the IWA and the NCBI and their service users whom answered our various interviews, surveys and
									emails that led to our vast bank of knowledge.

								<p>
									The ramp is brightly coloured to aid those with visual impairment. Our interviews with
									our stakeholder's from the NCBI concluded that the colour current accessibility ramps are darkly coloured
									and make using the ramps difficult for those with visual impairment, as they cannot easily make out the ramp.

									<h3>Something of note</h3>

								<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images/PieChart.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									Our survey found that 56% of our 97 stakeholder's who responded to our survey wanted to
									see us tackle the ramp access to the train over ticket barrier and lift issues. From this feedback
									we moved forward to desinging the AutoRamp.

									<h2>Our Journey So Far...</h2>
								</header>

								<span></span>

								<h3>
									Research
								</h3>
								<p>
									Initially, we found stakeholders in the <a href="https://www.iwa.ie/">IWA</a> and the <a href="https://www.ncbi.ie/">NCBI</a>.
									We began by finding our stakeholder's biggest problem with the rail system. Our stakeholder's problems ranged from lack of
									security to ramps being too steep for our stakeholder's to climb. Other problems included the ticket barrier's poor sensors
									and the reliability of the lifts at certain stops. But the problem that reoccured the most was that the rail
									service did not allow anyone who had mobility difficulties of any kind to travel without assistance. A major conclusion
									from most of our interviews and research was that this lack of independence has hindered the lives of many. We quickly realised
									that there is no reliable solution on the market for Irish Rail, as all of the current solutions would required major infrastructural
									changes. From this point we decided to find a solution that allowed rail users with accessibility issues to use the
									train independently.
								</p>

								<h3>Our Objectives</h3>
								<a href="images/MindMap.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/MindMap.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="500" /></a>

								<h3>Concept Design</h3>

								<p>
									From these objectives we came up with the AutoRamp. An easy to use autonomous ramp, that would be fixed on the
									platform in its docking station. When called on by the user via an app the AutoRamp positions itself between the
									train and the platform. It finds the door using machine vision and dead reckoning, constantly checking its surroundings
									for obstacles using machine vision and ultrasonic sensors. Having allowed the user onto the train the AutoRamp returns to its
									docking station using machine vision and its on board memory. Below is a clip of of concept design.
								</p>

									<source src="images/SketchBot.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								</video>
								<br />
								<br />
								<h3> Design Iteration 1</h3>
								<p>
									We tested our hypothesis for the AutoRamp using a small autonomous buggy. We tested how the AutoRamp
									would navigate obstacles using ultrasonic sensors and how it would make decisions based on the
									environment around it. We used this design iteration to test software and techniques that the AutoRamp
									would use to navigate the platform autonoumously. Having successfully built an autonomous buggy that
									could successfully navigate a hazardous environment we moved onto Design Iteration 2. Below is a clip
									of how the buggy did just that.
								</p>

								<video width="800" height="300" controls>
									<source src="images/SmallBot.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								</video>
								<br />
								<br />

								<h3><strong>Design Iteration 2</strong></h3>
								<p>
									Design Iteration 2 is a full scale prototype that we have developed to test our navigation system. Using
									the software developed for the first design iteration, plus the addition of machine vision, larger motors,
									quadature encoders, larger motor controller and more ultrasonic sensors we have successfully designed a navigation
									system for the AutoRamp. The navigation system has been successful in navigating the AutoRamp to a
									target via machine vision. Below is a clip of the AutoRamp doing just that.
									<h3> Successful Navigation Using Machine Vision</h3>
									<video width="800" height="300" controls>
										<source src="images/Navigation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
									</video>

								</p>

								<p>
									Using this prototype we are moving forward in perfecting the safety aspects of the
									AutoRamp. The AutoRamp must abide by various EU and Irish laws for accessibility ramps and autonomous bodies
									in public space. Along with this fact, this prototype is made from plywood and would not take the weight
									required by the current regulations (300Kg). Hence we must continue to model our next design iteration,
									which will comply with all relavent regulations, withstand the weight requied, navigate successfully to
									the train on a live platform and return successfully to its docking station.
								</p>

								<h3>Design and Modelling</h3>

								<a href="images/CurrentDesign.png" class="image featured"><img src="images/CurrentDesign.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" /></a>
								<p>
									We have modelled our final design for the AutoRamp and structurally analysed this design for a load of 300Kg
									with a factor of safety of 3 to ensure that the ramp will not fail under load.
								</p>
								<a href="images/Stress_Top.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/Stress_Top.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="400" /></a>
								<p>
									The structual analysis of the design concludes that a 6061 Aluminium body is the most suited material, due to its lightweight
									durability and strength. It also concludes that the design is sufficient and will function well.
